Hello
this is the source code from an old game I created at itch.io with a few friends.

See this link for the game:
https://knubbilito.itch.io/the-hole-in-my-belly

I decided to upload it as a test and to see if the code can be used for something good.
Please note that it is not the entire game, just the code because I do not know the
copyright of the other stuff..

The source code is meant to be an example and will not work directly with any other game unless a bit of tweaking here and there.
